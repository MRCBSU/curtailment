## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the description, which now does not start with the package name.

* Reduced the length of the title to less than 65 characters.

* Added \value (including output class) to the following .Rd files:
  * drawDiagramGeneric.Rd
  * findNSCdesigns.Rd
  * findSCdesigns.Rd
  * plotByWeight.Rd

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## devtools::check_rhub() results

0 errors √ | 0 warnings √ | 1 note x

* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION, but the spelling is correct

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies.
